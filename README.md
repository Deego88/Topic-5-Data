# Topic-5-Data
This program requires you to import the datetime class in python
#import datetime
a variable is created called current day which is likned with datetime.datetime.now() for present day

python counts 0,1,2,3 etc... where Monday is 0 index position.

we then can establish two conditions using if and elif:
  1- Yes weekday string text for index positions 0-4, Mon-Fri
  2- Yes weekend string text for index positions 5-6, Sat-Sun
